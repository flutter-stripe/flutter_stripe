# Address Sheet Implementation Guide

The Address Sheet is a pre-built UI component that allows you to collect shipping or billing addresses from your users in a Flutter application using Stripe's native UI components.

## Installation

Make sure you have the `flutter_stripe` package installed in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_stripe: ^latest_version
```

### Set up Stripe [Server Side] [Client Side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

#### Server-side

This integration requires endpoints on your server that talk to the Stripe API. Use one official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your server. [Follow the steps here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#setup-server-side)

#### Client-side

The Flutter SDK is open source, fully documented.

To install the SDK, follow these steps:
 - Run the commmand `flutter pub add flutter_stripe`
 - This will add a line like this to your project's pubspec.yaml with the latest package version


For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases for the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/managing-subscriptions-for-activity-on-github/viewing-your-subscriptions#watching-releases-for-a-repository).


When your app starts, configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) so that it can make requests to the Stripe API. 

```dart
void main() async {
  Stripe.publishableKey = stripePublishableKey;
  runApp(const App());
}
```

Use your [test mode](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#obtain-api-keys) keys while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.


### Basic Implementation

Here's a basic example of how to implement the Address Sheet:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';

AddressSheet(
  onSubmit: (details) {
    // Handle the submitted address details
    print(details.toJson());
  },
  onError: (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur
    print(error.error.localizedMessage);
  },
  params: AddressSheetParams(),
)
```

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

- `onSubmit`: Callback function that is called when the user successfully submits their address information. Receives a `CollectAddressResult` object containing:
  - `address`: The collected address details
  - `name`: The customer's name
  - `phoneNumber`: The customer's phone number (optional)

- `onError`: Callback function that is called when an error occurs or when the user closes the sheet before submitting. Receives a `StripeException` object.

- `params`: An `AddressSheetParams` object that configures the address sheet behavior and appearance.

### Address Result Structure

The `CollectAddressResult` object contains the following information:

```dart
class CollectAddressResult {
  final Address address;
  final String name;
  final String? phoneNumber;
}
```

The `Address` object contains standard address fields like street, city, state, postal code, and country.

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to implement the Address Sheet in a Flutter screen:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';

class AddressSheetExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const AddressSheetExample({super.key});

  @override
  State<AddressSheetExample> createState() => _AddressSheetExampleState();
}

class _AddressSheetExampleState extends State<AddressSheetExample> {
  String? result;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Address Sheet Example'),
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            AddressSheet(
              onError: (error) {
                setState(() {
                  result = error.error.localizedMessage;
                });
              },
              onSubmit: (details) {
                setState(() {
                  result = details.toJson().toString();
                });
              },
              params: AddressSheetParams(),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            Text(result ?? ''),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the Address Sheet behavior by configuring the `AddressSheetParams`. This allows you to:
- Set default values
- Configure which fields are required
- Customize the appearance
- Set specific country restrictions

## Platform Support

The Address Sheet is supported on both iOS and Android platforms, providing a native UI experience on each platform.

## Best Practices

1. Always handle both the `onSubmit` and `onError` callbacks to ensure a good user experience.
2. Validate the collected address information before using it in your application.
3. Consider implementing proper error handling and display appropriate error messages to users.
4. Store the collected address information securely if you need to reuse it later.
