  /// your payment form. When called, it will automatically load an on-page
  /// modal UI to collect bank account details and verification, accept a
  /// hosted mandate agreement, and confirm the PaymentIntent when the user
  /// submits the form. Note that there are some additional requirements
  /// to this flow that are not covered in this reference.
  /// Refer to our integration guide for more details.
  /// When you confirm a PaymentIntent, it needs to have an attached
  /// PaymentMethod. stripe.confirmAcssDebitPayment automatically
  ///  creates a new PaymentMethod for you when your customer completes
  /// the modal UI. It can also be called with an existing PaymentMethod,
  /// which will load the modal UI to collect a new mandate agreement.
  /// These use cases are detailed in the sections that follow.

  /// complete. During that time, you should disable your form from being
  /// resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner.
  /// If you receive an error result, you should be sure to show that
  /// error to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator.
